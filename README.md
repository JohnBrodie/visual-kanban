Visual Kanban
=============

Visual Kanban is a simple kanban tool for personal use.
At the moment, it does not allow for collaboration between
multiple people, but such functionality could be implemented
by swapping out the models.


The program is implemented using MVC, and the GUI is implemented
using Swing.
